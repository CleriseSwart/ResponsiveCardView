# Card Component Web Application

This project implements a card component for a web application, designed to display information with an attractive layout. The card consists of an image, title, badge, content, and author details.

## Card Component

The `Card` component is created using React and styled with CSS. It features a flexible layout that adjusts for desktop and mobile devices. The card includes images, badges, text, and author information for a visually appealing presentation.

## File Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

1. **Card.css:** Contains the styling rules for the card component. It defines the layout, colors, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.

2. **Card.js:** Implements the React `Card` component. This file contains JSX code for the card structure, incorporating images and content.

3. **App.js:** The main application file that renders the `Card` component. This is the entry point for the application.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open a terminal and install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the application with `npm start`.
5. Access the application in a web browser.

## Styling

The card component is styled with a clean and modern design. The CSS in `Card.css` includes global styling, card container styling, image container styling, content block styling, header styling, badge styling, info section styling, and a responsive media query for mobile devices.

## Media and Assets

The card component utilizes image assets (`card-left-2.png`, `Lock.png`, and `Profile.png`) to enhance visual appeal.

## Responsive Design

The card component adapts to different screen sizes with a media query for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on smaller screens.
